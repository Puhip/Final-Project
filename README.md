# simple-node-js-react-npm-app

This repository is for the
[Build a Node.js and React app with npm]
[Jenkins User Documentation](https://jenkins.io/doc/).

The repository contains a simple Node.js and React application which generates
a web page with the content "Welcome to React" and is accompanied by a test to
check that the application renders satisfactorily.

The `jenkins` directory contains an example of the `Jenkinsfile` (i.e. Pipeline)
we'll be creating during the tutorial and the `scripts` subdirectory
contains shell scripts with commands that are executed when Jenkins processes
the "Test" and "Deliver" stages of Pipeline.
